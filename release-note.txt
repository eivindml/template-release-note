The introduction. A short paragraph. Make this personal if appropriate. Eg. "Season greetings, everyone! You asked, Santa listened - this update is exactly what you ask for this Christmas." Make it colorful with emojis 🤘🏻 where appropriate.

TL; DR
• An extra short summary of these notes goes here.

NEW 👶🏻
• This is where you layout any new features.
• Explain where these features are within your app.
• How do users find these new features?
• Which users will this benefits, or how exactly will this benefits them?
• E.g. "[Who benefits?] Apple Watch users will be particularly happy with the latest release. [Why?] We now automatically support handoff with your Mac. [Where/how?] Don’t forget to have your bluetooth turned on, you can do it]!"

IMPROVED 👨🏼‍🎨
• If improving an existing feature, rather than something that’s brand new, use the "Improvements" title instead of "New".
• If you've improved something as a result of user feedback, consider a sentence like, "you asked, we listened". A great way to make your users feel valued.

FIXED 👨🏼‍🔧
• List out any major bugs that might have affected many users.
• If you've only addressed minor fixes, or nothing specific, use something like:
• E.g. "Minor Bug fixes"
• Keep the "Fixed" title if you've included other titled sections.

The sign off. Similar to the introduction, this could be personalized if appropriate. You could easily have a couple of variations of this in your locker.

FEEDBACK 👨🏼‍💻
Finally Feedback. Add the feedback email address and welcome users thoughts. Eg. “Submit your suggestions for improvements to  feedback@yourapp.co we value your feedback”
