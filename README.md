# Release Note Template

Template to use for your app release notes. App Store doesn't support any formatting of release notes, so this is a template to keep things somewhat formatted and infromative. See the file `release-note.txt`.

## Versioning of releases

Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Short summary:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format
